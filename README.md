# Twitter-US-Airline-Sentiment-Analysis
## Dataset 
The dataset chosen by our group is called “Twitter US Airline Sentiment” which originally came from Crowdflower’s Data for Everyone Library. This data was downloaded from Kaggle ( https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment) as a CSV file and contains tweets from Twitter written by airline customers in February 2015. The data set contains 14,640 rows and 15 columns. Contributors classified each tweet as either “positive”, “neutral”, or “negative” and cited the reason for a negative classification as well as a confidence score. 

## What interested us
1. What topics travelers tend to discuss often

Also, the sentiment analysis can help to make better market strategies. Based on sentiment analysis the companies will come to know how customers are thinking and take competitive advantage.
